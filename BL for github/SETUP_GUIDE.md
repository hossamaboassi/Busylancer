# BusyLancer Platform Setup Guide

## What I've Built for You

I've created a **functional backend system** for your BusyLancer platform that includes:

### ✅ **Working Features:**
1. **User Registration** - Users can sign up and get approved by admin
2. **User Login** - Simple email-based login system
3. **Job Posting** - Businesses can post jobs
4. **Job Applications** - BusyLancers can apply to jobs
5. **Admin Panel** - Approve users and manage the platform
6. **Email Notifications** - Welcome emails and job notifications
7. **Database System** - Stores all user data, jobs, and applications

### 📁 **New Files Created:**
- `config/database.php` - Database connection and setup
- `api/register.php` - User registration API
- `api/login.php` - User login API
- `api/jobs.php` - Job posting and listing API
- `api/apply.php` - Job application API
- `api/check-auth.php` - Authentication check API
- `api/logout.php` - Logout functionality
- `js/busylancer-app.js` - Frontend JavaScript for forms
- `admin/index.php` - Admin panel for user management

## 🚀 **How to Set Up (Step by Step)**

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. **Create a MySQL database** named `busylancer_db`
2. **Update database credentials** in `config/database.php`:
   ```php
   $username = 'your_database_username';
   $password = 'your_database_password';
   ```

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. **Upload all files** to your web hosting server
2. **Make sure PHP is enabled** on your hosting
3. **Ensure the `api/` folder is accessible** via web

### Step 3: Test the System
1. **Visit your website** (busy-lancer.com)
2. **Try registering** a new user
3. **Check the admin panel** at `busy-lancer.com/admin/`
4. **Approve users** in the admin panel

### Step 4: Admin Access
1. **Register with email** `admin@busy-lancer.com`
2. **Or change the admin email** in `admin/index.php` line 6:
   ```php
   $admin_email = 'your-email@domain.com';
   ```

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### User Registration Flow:
1. User fills registration form → Data saved to database
2. User status = "pending" → Admin gets notified
3. Admin approves user → User gets email notification
4. User can now login and use the platform

### Job Posting Flow:
1. Business user logs in → Can post jobs
2. Job appears in listings → BusyLancers can see it
3. BusyLancer applies → Business gets email notification
4. Business can review applications in dashboard

### Login System:
- **Simple email-based login** (no password required for alpha testing)
- **Session-based authentication**
- **Automatic redirect** to appropriate dashboard

## 📊 **Admin Panel Features**

Access at: `your-domain.com/admin/`

- **User Management**: Approve/reject new registrations
- **Statistics**: View total users, jobs, applications
- **Job Monitoring**: See all posted jobs
- **Application Tracking**: Monitor job applications

## 🎯 **What You Can Test Now**

### For Users:
1. **Register** as BusyLancer, Business, or Agent
2. **Login** with your email
3. **Post jobs** (if registered as Business)
4. **Apply to jobs** (if registered as BusyLancer)
5. **Receive email notifications**

### For You (Admin):
1. **Monitor registrations** in admin panel
2. **Approve/reject users**
3. **View platform statistics**
4. **Track job postings and applications**

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

This is an **alpha version** with simplified security:
- No password requirement (email-only login)
- Basic session management
- Simple admin authentication

**For production**, you should add:
- Password authentication
- Email verification
- Better admin security
- Input validation
- CSRF protection

## 📧 **Email Configuration**

The system sends emails for:
- Welcome messages
- Account approval notifications
- Job application notifications

**Make sure your hosting supports PHP mail()** or configure SMTP settings.

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:
1. **Database connection error**: Check credentials in `config/database.php`
2. **Forms not working**: Ensure `js/busylancer-app.js` is loaded
3. **Admin panel access denied**: Check admin email in `admin/index.php`
4. **Emails not sending**: Check hosting mail configuration

### Test Commands:
- Visit: `your-domain.com/api/check-auth.php` (should show JSON)
- Check database tables are created automatically
- Verify file permissions (folders should be readable)

## 🎉 **Next Steps**

Once this is working, you can:
1. **Test with real users** and gather feedback
2. **Add more features** (messaging, payments, etc.)
3. **Improve the UI/UX** based on user feedback
4. **Add AI features** for job matching
5. **Scale up** the platform

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check your hosting error logs
3. Verify database connection
4. Test each API endpoint individually
